Dynamic Game Creation that jumps you directly into the game you just made

Games are created by either adding a code or choosing parameters that will change how the game behaves in different ways.
Game data will then be saved per user (by session) and then people can view specific game groups (made by a key) or by how all users played that specific game.

_Made with the intention to play with twitch viewers and view data on how viewers played their games_
